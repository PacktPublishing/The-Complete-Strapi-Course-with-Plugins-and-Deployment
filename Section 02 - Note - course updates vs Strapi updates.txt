Note: course updates vs Strapi updates
The most recent version of Strapi for which this course and its codebase have been tested and updated is:
version 4.5.4  (updated December 2022)

Come back to this lesson in the future, if you want to check for ongoing updates

In the next lesson you'll be creating your Strapi project: I suggest just following along the lesson, as in that way you'll install the most recent version available, even if more recent than the one I mentioned above.

Don't worry, as I frequently check my code for updates, so you shouldn't encounter particular issues due to the Strapi updates. But in case you think you've found a very recent update that introduces a bug in the course codebase, please let me know with a post in the Q&A of the lesson that is impacted.

Thanks for helping me keep this course always up to date!
