Reference repository for this deployment section
In this section we'll be deploying our Strapi app to Render.com. This cloud provider has itself published a reference project for Strapi deployment with Render.com, which I have taken as a guideline for this section. They also have a related docs page. Here I include the links to such resources, in case you wanted to check these out, even if it's not needed at all, as we'll be building everything from scratch.
